# Platform Of Trust Standards repository

This repository contains everything we need to standardize the Platform Of Trust
APIs.

The Platform Of Trust core ontology can be found as a JSON-LD
ontology file under [ontologies/pot.jsonld](ontologies/pot.jsonld).

The HTML version of the ontology documentation is hosted at our 
[Github Pages](https://platformoftrust.github.io/standards/)

_Please note that this repository is under active development, and the IRIs
and URIs in the ontology files are subject to change at any time._
